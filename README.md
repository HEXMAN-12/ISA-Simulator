# ISA Simulator

The ISA Simulator is a C++ program that simulates the execution of programs written in a custom instruction set architecture (ISA). This simulator allows users to load programs, execute instructions, and visualize the state of registers and memory during execution. It supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, loading, and storing values, and provides an intuitive interface for understanding the behavior of programs in the simulated architecture.

## Features

- Simulates basic operations such as addition, subtraction, loading, and storing values.
- Provides a clear visualization of register and memory states during program execution.
- Supports user-defined programs through a simple instruction format.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/isa-simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd isa-simulator
   ```

### Running the Simulator

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o isa_simulator
   ```
2. Execute the compiled binary:

   ```bash
   ./isa_simulator
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input program instructions and execute them.

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
